# Chica Bot Web

### About
This is the web panel for my Discord bot [Chica](https://github.com/driedsponge/chica).

It is made using Laravel, Vue, Tailwind, and InertiaJS to tie it all together.

It is still a work in progress, and is nowhere near finished. The end goal is to have a web space where users can see all the memes they have created in their servers.

### Custom Artisan Commands

- `app:set-admin {discordID}` - Sets the user as an admin for the web panel. You can add the `--revoke` flag to revert
to a normal user.
